##Concept / Story:##
You are a “user” trying to hack something, and you there are “bots” trying to stop you. *(Needs better information and a lot of improvement)*

##Tools:##
You will have a “block” you can use to slow down the security. There will be a “tracer” or “trail” behind you that the security can find and trace. A skill to “reset”, “removes”, or “covers up” that trail. *(More “Skills” to come)*

##Objective:##
The objective is to collect the main points of “information”, about 4 or 5, maybe more. They are used to move to the next “sector” or “level”. There will be other bits of collectable information to enable the use certain skills, like “blocks” and “trail covering”.

##Design:##
It’s going to have a classic feel, kind of like an old screen effect, and with simple graphics, and a horizontal line that comes down the screen every so often.  A “Terminal” style menu. *(The terminal menus will probably be a typing style, requiring the user to type the commands)* The “security bots” are going to be triangles that spin. The levels will probably feel like Pac-Man. The movement is going to be smooth, not block by block, but still in a grid area. The whole game is going to have a bloom effect. The main menu will go through an initialization process, where the text comes on to the screen, like a boot sequence.  During the initialize process, the game logo will appear, and remain at the top right of the terminal.

##Sound:##
When the game starts, there will be a classic computer boot up sound. The main menu “Terminal” will have a few beeps as well. The movement will not have a sound, collecting “bits” will. The closer the “bots” get, the faster the sonar beeps.
